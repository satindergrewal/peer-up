# Relay Server Configuration
# This server runs on a VPS with a public IP
# It relays connections between home and client nodes

identity:
  # Path to the key file for persistent peer identity
  # This file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
  # IMPORTANT: Keep this file backed up - your peer ID depends on it
  key_file: "relay_node.key"

network:
  # Addresses to listen on
  # Use port 7777 (non-standard to avoid IPFS swarms)
  # Make sure this port is open in your firewall (ufw allow 7777/tcp)
  listen_addresses:
    - "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7777"
    - "/ip6/::/tcp/7777"

security:
  # Path to authorized_keys file (for future use)
  # Currently not enforced - relay is open to all connections
  # In the future, only peers in this file will be allowed to make reservations
  authorized_keys_file: "relay_authorized_keys"

  # Enable connection gating (currently disabled for simplicity)
  # Set to true once you want to restrict relay usage to authorized peers only
  enable_connection_gating: false
